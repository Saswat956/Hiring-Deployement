## Hiring-Model-Flask-Deployment

• This repository consists of files required to deploy a Machine Learning Web App created with Flask on Heroku platform.

• If you want to view the deployed model, click on the following link:
Deployed at: https://hiringmodel200x.herokuapp.com/

• If you are searching for Code, Algorithms used and Accuracy of the model.. you can find it here. • Please do ⭐ the repository, if it helped you in anyway.

----- Important Note -----
• If you encounter this webapp as shown in the picture given below, it is occuring just because free dynos for this particular month provided by Heroku have been completely used. You can access the webpage on 1st of the next month.
• Sorry for the inconvenience.

### Prerequisites
You must have Scikit Learn, Pandas (for Machine Leraning Model) and Flask (for API) installed.

### Project Structure
This project has four major parts :
1. model.py - This contains code fot our Machine Learning model to predict employee salaries absed on trainign data in 'hiring.csv' file.
2. app.py - This contains Flask APIs that receives employee details through GUI or API calls, computes the precited value based on our model and returns it.
3. request.py - This uses requests module to call APIs already defined in app.py and dispalys the returned value.
4. templates - This folder contains the HTML template to allow user to enter employee detail and displays the predicted employee salary.

### Running the project
1. Ensure that you are in the project home directory. Create the machine learning model by running below command -
```
python model.py
```
This would create a serialized version of our model into a file model.pkl

2. Run app.py using below command to start Flask API
```
python app.py
```
By default, flask will run on port 5000.

3. Navigate to URL http://localhost:5000

You should be able to view the homepage as below :

Enter valid numerical values in all 3 input boxes and hit Predict.

If everything goes well, you should  be able to see the predcited salary vaule on the HTML page!

4. You can also send direct POST requests to FLask API using Python's inbuilt request module
Run the beow command to send the request with some pre-popuated values -
```
python request.py
```
